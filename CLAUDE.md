# aify-comms — Claude Code project notes

Inter-agent communication hub: messaging, channels, file sharing, active dispatch, and a dashboard for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and other MCP-connected coding agents. This file is loaded by Claude Code when working **on this repo itself**; usage docs for someone installing aify-comms live in [README.md](README.md).

## Primary entry points

- [README.md](README.md) — what the service is, setup, day-to-day usage.
- [install.claude.md](install.claude.md) / [install.codex.md](install.codex.md) / [install.hermes.md](install.hermes.md) / [install.opencode.md](install.opencode.md) / [install.pi.md](install.pi.md) — per-runtime install guides (wrappers, hooks, verification).
- [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) — rationale for non-obvious design choices and current runtime limits.
- [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) — known limitations, deferred work, watch-items, and pre-existing backlog.
- `.claude/skills/aify-comms/SKILL.md` — agent-facing usage guide (tool reference, multi-instance matrix, status table).
- `.claude/skills/aify-comms-debug/SKILL.md` — known issues and fixes (AbsolutePathBuf, hard-reset sequence, buffer_full, orphaned runs, stale bridges).

## Developing on this repo

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build            # rebuilds the Python service container
curl http://localhost:8800/health        # should return {"status":"healthy"}
```

Changes under `service/`, `mcp/sse_server.py`, and `config/` are COPY'd into the container image — rebuild after editing any of them. Changes under `mcp/stdio/` affect host-side bridges and MCP client sessions, so reinstall/restart `aify-comms`, `codex-aify`, or `claude-aify` after editing them. Changes to docs, skills, `install.sh`, and `.claude/` do not need a container rebuild, but installer changes require rerunning `install.sh`.

The MCP stdio bridges under `mcp/stdio/` run on the **host**, not in the container. They are loaded by Claude Code / Codex at startup, so changes there require restarting the client wrapper (`claude-aify` / `codex-aify`) — not a container rebuild.

## Versioning — one file, and a test that enforces it

**The release version lives in the repo-root `VERSION` file. Nothing else may declare one.**

`scripts/stamp.sh` bakes it into `service/_build_stamp.json` (the container has no repo root — the same reason the git sha is stamped), and `service/config.py` reads it from there, so the service, the root endpoint, `/openapi.json` and Dashboard Next all report it. On the Node side `mcp/stdio/version.js` exports `AIFY_VERSION`, imported by every MCP handshake and by `BRIDGE_VERSION` (which also reaches the control plane as `bridgeVersion`).

**To cut a release:** edit `VERSION`, set `mcp/stdio/version.js` + `mcp/stdio/package.json` + `mcp/stdio/package-lock.json` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to match, run the suites, `bash scripts/stamp.sh`, rebuild, **re-run `install.sh` for each client if anything under `mcp/stdio/` changed**, then tag. (`plugin.json` was missing from this list until v0.2.0 even though `test_version_single_source.py` has always asserted it — the recipe was one step shorter than the test. `install.sh` was missing for the same reason: `aify-doctor` fails `bridge-installed` after a bridge edit, and the release is not shippable until that is green.) `test_version_single_source.py` and `mcp/stdio/tests/version-consistency.test.js` fail the suite if any of those disagree or if a new file hardcodes a version literal — so a missed step is a red test, not a silent lie.

**Why this exists:** until 2026-08-03 four components each carried their own version and none tracked a release. The service reported `0.1.0` (a stale `SERVICE_VERSION` in `.env`, which overrides the stamp), `config.py`'s default said `4.0.0`, Dashboard Next hardcoded `0.1.0`, and the bridge said `4.0.0` in **eight** hand-copied places — while the project actually shipped v0.1, v0.1.1 and v0.1.2. No single edit could have corrected it. **Do not set `SERVICE_VERSION` in `.env`**; env wins over the stamp and re-creates exactly that bug.

## Repo layout (what matters)

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `service/` | FastAPI backend, SQLite persistence, dashboard HTML, dispatch logic. Rebuild container after changes. |
| `service/terminal_snapshot.py`, `service/terminal_diagnostics.py`, `service/status_engine.py` | PURE, unit-tested service modules extracted out of `api_v2.py` for the same reason as the bridge predicates below: logic that lives in a 23k-line router is only reachable through the app, so it can only fail in production. `terminal_diagnostics.py` (which line of a dead terminal's output explains the death) is the pattern to follow for anything new — put behaviour here and import it, don't grow `api_v2.py`. |
| `service/new_dashboard/*.mjs` | Pure dashboard modules with their own `*.test.mjs` (`terminal-input`, `cli-resume`, `sessions-list`, …). `app.js` is ~4.9k lines and only reachable by source-regex tests, which cannot fail on wrong logic — put new behaviour in a module here instead. |
| `mcp/stdio/` | Host-side MCP bridges (`server.js`, `claude-channel.js`, `runtimes.js`, `runtime-markers.js`, `notify-check.js`). Restart client wrapper after changes. |
| `mcp/stdio/*-predicates.js`, `register-identity.js` | PURE, unit-tested helpers extracted out of the bridges so their logic can fail a test instead of only failing in production. `doctor-predicates.js` (env liveness) and `register-identity.js` (resident launch-identity warning) are the pattern to follow — `doctor.js` was untestable until its predicates moved out, and the first thing the new test caught was a real bug. |
| `mcp/sse_server.py` | SSE MCP transport (runs inside the container). Rebuild container after changes. |
| `.claude/skills/aify-comms/` | Usage skill — tool reference, workflow, status table, multi-instance matrix. |
| `.claude/skills/aify-comms-debug/` | Troubleshooting skill — known issues and fixes. |
| `.agents/skills/aify-comms*/` | Mirrors of the two skills for Codex agents. Keep in sync. |
| `install.sh` | Client installer. Targets Claude, Codex, or Hermes via `--client` (OpenCode/Pi installs are intentionally disabled). |
| `examples/team-setup/` | Example team definition (manager, coder, tester, etc.) showing how to register a multi-role team. |

## Development notes

- **`install.sh` copies the bridge runtime into a native dotfolder.** The installer copies `mcp/stdio` + its `node_modules` into `~/.aify-comms/` (override with `AIFY_HOME`) and points every wrapper + MCP config at that native copy, not at the repo checkout. Reason: the repo often sits on a slow 9p/WSL2 bind-mount where the bridge takes ~5s to load — that blows hermes' hardcoded 0.75s MCP-discovery window; the native copy loads in ~0.3s. Re-running `install.sh` refreshes the copy, so **security fixes flow on reinstall** (no longer automatic). Consequence: editing files under `mcp/stdio/` now requires re-running `install.sh` (to re-copy) **and** restarting the client wrapper — not just a wrapper restart.
- **Forward-slash `cwd` on Windows** for Codex agents. The bridge auto-normalizes, but any new Codex thread must be created with a forward-slash cwd or it'll fail `thread/resume` later.
- **Re-register is a full state refresh** for everything except `description`. Tests and dev workflows should assume session state is wiped on re-register — see DECISIONS.md.
- **Skill files live in two places:** `.claude/skills/aify-comms*/` and `.agents/skills/aify-comms*/`. Keep them in sync when editing.
- **The live-status cache is in-memory (`_LIVE_STATE_CACHE`, `service/routers/api_v2.py`), and the service MUST stay single-worker.** As of 2026-06-18 (`97a497a`) the derived agent-status cache is a process-global in-memory dict, not a SQLite table — this resolved the recurring `database is locked` 503s (the old `agent_live_state` table was refresh-written on every dashboard poll). It is only correct with ONE uvicorn process / one event loop, so never add `--workers > 1` without first moving the cache to a shared store (Redis) or sticky routing. The `agent_live_state` table is vestigial (retained for schema compat, read/written by nothing) — don't debug status from a table dump; use `comms_agent_info` / the dashboard. See DECISIONS.md, "Live-status cache is in-memory, not SQLite".
- **Container name is `aify-comms-service`** on the `aify-comms-network` network. Compose project name is driven by `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in `.env`.
- **No secrets in commits.** `.env` is gitignored; `config/service.json` is generated by `setup.sh`.

## Verify a change actually took effect — `aify-doctor`

**Every deploy path in this repo fails silently.** No error, everything looks installed, and what you changed is not what is running. This bit us repeatedly: a container serving the previous build; `~/.aify-comms` holding new bridge code while every RUNNING wrapper still executes the copy it loaded at boot; an agent registered but with no `AIFY_AGENT_ID` in its process, so its status is dead. **Do not report success from the absence of an error.**

```bash
aify-doctor            # human-readable report
aify-doctor --json     # {ok, checks:[{id, ok, code, detail, fix}]} — for scripted/agent checks
aify-doctor --strict   # exit 1 if any check failed
```

It proves each claim against the running system rather than checking that a file exists:

| check | catches |
|---|---|
| `service` | container serving a build ≠ repo HEAD (a healthy `/health` says nothing about *which* code) |
| `bridge-installed` | commits since the installed marker that actually **touched `mcp/stdio/`** — i.e. you edited the bridge and never re-ran `install.sh`. Being behind by docs- or service-only commits is reported as CLEAN (with the count), so this check does not cry wolf on every commit |
| `bridge-terminal` | the installed `node-pty` native module does not load → terminal-backed runtimes silently cannot start |
| `bridge-running` | **running** bridges started BEFORE the last install → still executing the old code. Names the agents that must restart. **Linux-only** — it reads `/proc`, so on Windows it SKIPS and nothing verifies this. |
| `agent-identity` | a REGISTERED agent whose process has no `AIFY_AGENT_ID` (status structurally dead). An unregistered plain session is legitimately id-less and is not flagged. **Linux-only**, same caveat. |
| `env-bridge` | no environment bridge is actually **ONLINE** → dashboard-managed spawns cannot run. Keys on each row's server-derived `status`, and names the registered-but-dead ones with their `lastSeen`. (Until `756f3a5` it counted *registered* rows and reported "2 connected" with zero bridges alive — the exact false green this tool exists to prevent.) |
| `wrappers`, `runtimes` | the wrappers are on PATH and the runtime CLIs exist |
| `usage-openai` | the ChatGPT quota token works — by calling the API, since an expired token passes a file check |

**On Windows, `bridge-running` and `agent-identity` are skips** — so after `install.sh` nothing proves a *running* wrapper is executing the new bridge code. Relaunching wrappers remains a manual, unverified step on this host (tracked as v0.2 item B1: have each bridge report its build stamp on heartbeat, which is platform-independent).

Operator-facing versions of these flows (install / update integrations / install / update container) are the **Agent playbooks** table in [README.md](README.md).

## Testing a change

```bash
# Backend change (service/ or mcp/sse_server.py)
docker compose up -d --build && curl http://localhost:8800/health

# Bridge change (mcp/stdio/)
# Restart codex-aify or claude-aify in whatever session tests the change.
node --check mcp/stdio/server.js
node --check mcp/stdio/runtimes.js

# Python change
python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('service/routers/api_v2.py').read())"
```

Full end-to-end test is a two-session live round-trip. Register two agents, use `comms_send` from one to the other, verify the target wakes or receives a steer/queued turn according to capability, and verify the response is threaded back in chat.
